This Python script appears to perform a series of tasks related to data extraction from a MySQL database, processing the data, and uploading it to Google Drive, with the capability to notify users through Google Chat. Let's break down the code into sections:

Imports
The script uses various Python libraries for different purposes. Here are the imported libraries:

paramiko: Used for SSH connections.
mysql.connector: Used for connecting to MySQL databases.
json, requests: Used for handling JSON data and making HTTP requests.
openpyxl: Used for working with Excel files.
datetime: Used for obtaining the current date and time.
pydrive.auth, pydrive.drive: Used for interacting with Google Drive.
os: Used for operating system-related tasks.
SSH Connection
The script establishes an SSH connection to a server with the specified host, port, username, and password. It then creates a direct-tcpip channel for forwarding local connections to the MySQL server.

MySQL Connection
Using the established SSH connection, the script connects to a MySQL database with the specified host, username, password, and database name.

MySQL Query
A sample SQL query is executed to fetch data from the local.test table.

Data Processing and Excel Export
If the query results contain data, the script creates an Excel file (data_{current_date}.xlsx) and writes the data into it. The Excel file is then saved locally.

Google Drive Authentication
The script authenticates with Google Drive using the pydrive library. It checks if the credentials file (mycreds.txt) exists and creates one if not. It loads the credentials and prepares for interaction with Google Drive.

Google Drive File Handling
The script checks if the Excel file already exists on Google Drive within a specified folder. If it does, the existing file is deleted. The script then uploads the Excel file to Google Drive and obtains a link to the uploaded file.

Google Chat Notification
Finally, the script sends a message to Google Chat, providing a link to the uploaded file if data was present in the MySQL query results or indicating that no data was found.

Exception Handling
The script includes exception handling to capture various types of errors, such as authentication errors, SSH connection errors, MySQL errors, or general exceptions. The connections are properly closed in the finally block.

Overall, this script automates the process of extracting data from a MySQL database, creating an Excel file, and uploading it to Google Drive while providing notifications along the way.
